title: Course Website Overhaul
date: 2025-3-16

**Massive Changes**: The course website has been *massively* overhauled, with 
content now existing in both technical and literacy tracks, allowing for a much
larger range of students within the course. The I2 Grimoire is now created and 
integrated with the website. Colab notebook links now pull straight from GitHub,
allowing for centralization of updates. FInally, the aesthetics of the website
with regards to content has been greatly reorganized. This should all contribute
to a much more streamlined learning experience!
