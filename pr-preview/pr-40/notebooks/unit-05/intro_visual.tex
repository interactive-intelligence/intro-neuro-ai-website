Imagine you got a little too into neural networks and decided to replace your eyes with convolutional neural networks. You may use any sensors, hardware, brain computer interfaces, fungi, wires, Von Neumann computing, neuromorphic computing, or robots that you like (that seem vaguely feasible). How would you replace the algorithms run by the visual cortex with algorithms like those of convolution neural networks?

\item What hardware did you use to implement this? In your opinion, is it possible to use the existing biological nervous system to run computation algorithms like CNNs? Why?
