Hi I’m Shey! I’m a junior majoring in computer science, and I’m interested in how AI can contribute to healthcare. I found the I2 Intro Neuro/AI course to be a good starting point for developing interest and exploring more outside of class. One more cool thing I want to explore is freestyle skiing, feel free to reach out if you’re interested as well!
