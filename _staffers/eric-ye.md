Hello, I'm Eric, and I joined this club mostly because I found the idea of intelligence really interesting. Is it something that is special and unique, or is it something that could be recreated? I'm leaning towards the latter due to the impressive recent advancements in AI. In my spare time, I enjoy reading and hiking, and I occasionally play tennis.
