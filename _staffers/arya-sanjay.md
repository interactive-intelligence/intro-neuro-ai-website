Hey, I’m Arya, one of the Education Leads of the I2 Intro Course! I took the intro course myself because I was interested in ML and ethics, and wanted to learn more, but didn't know where to start. I really enjoyed the intro course, and since I love teaching, I was a TA for it. Now, I'm excited to co-lead it and work with the rest of leadership to make this the best quarter yet! I’m a CS student at UW, and outside of school, I like exploring new food spots, music, and trying new things.
