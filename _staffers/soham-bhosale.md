Hey, Iâ€™m Soham! I am a freshman majoring in computer science and very interested in AI and its applications in the medical field as well as AI ethics. I really enjoyed exploring and learning about these topics in the I2 Intro Course and that is why I wanted to TA for it. Outside of school, I like traveling, reading and playing tennis!
