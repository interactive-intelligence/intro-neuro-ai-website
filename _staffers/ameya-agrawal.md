Hey there, I'm Ameya! I took the intro course myself the first time it was run and absolutely loved it, so I decided to TA for it, and now I'm leading it! I am fortunate to be surrounded by intelligent, dedicated i2 leadership who share a common passion for Neuro/AI and are always happy to help. I really enjoyed this course as it provided me with a great starting point to further explore Neuro/AI and I hope it does the same for you. Outside of i2, I'm a junior in CS at UW, and I absolutely love solving puzzles, playing video games and am always down for a game of pool!
