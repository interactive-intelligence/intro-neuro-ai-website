I'm Jeffrey J, a second year, and I'm interested in I2 because of AI & ML, as I plan to use it to eventually take over the world. Other than that, I'm still learning, and am also interested in how it can make education more accessible and personalized. Outside of I2, I have a lot of other interests that change semi-frequently. Right now, I'm into cardistry/magic and Roblox game development.
