Hey, I'm Vibhav! I'm currently a junior here at UW in CS. I had been interested in learning ML since I came to the university, but was completely overwhelmed by where to start. The intro course was exactly what I needed! I liked the course enough to TA it the following quarter, and now I'm thrilled to be leading it with Ameya! In my free time I enjoy running and videogames among many other nerdy things.
