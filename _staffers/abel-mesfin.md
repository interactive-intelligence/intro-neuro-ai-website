Hello! I'm Abel, a first year who intends to major in some variation of applied math and neuroscience with a minor in philosophy and bioethics. Before taking the intro course, I was really interested in approaches to machine learning and how neuroscience inspired them. AI is clearly revolutionizing everyday sectors, and I find it important to consider, and help others consider, the intuition and fundamental mechanics behind it all. Academia aside, I play more than a handful ball sports; I enjoy biking, going on walks, spending time with friends; and other activities I can't immediately think of!
