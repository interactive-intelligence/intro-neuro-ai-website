Hey, I'm Misha, one of the Education Leads for the I2 Intro Course! I am a CS student at UW focused on machine learning and its applications in neuroscience. I became part of the I2 leadership because I really enjoy teaching and helping other students recognize their potential. Through my roles in the Intro Course and the Data Science Initiative, I aim to help more students learn practical skills in ML, AI, and neuroscience, and feel more confident in these subjects. Outside of college, I am a classical Indian dancer and write poetry. I love Bollywood (movies and music), playing ultimate frisbee, and traveling.
