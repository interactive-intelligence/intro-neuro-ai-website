Hey, I'm Misha! I am a CS student at UW focused on machine learning and its applications in neuroscience. Outside of college, I am a classical Indian dancer and write poetry. I love Bollywood (movies and music), playing ultimate frisbee, and traveling. I became part of the i2 leadership because I really enjoy teaching and helping other students recognize their potential. Through my roles in i2 and the Data Science Initiative, I aim to help more students learn about machine learning, AI, and neuroscience, and feel more confident in these subjects.
